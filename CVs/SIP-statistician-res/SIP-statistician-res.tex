\begin{rSection}{\Large Overview of Qualifications}
    Adaptive student of mathematics and neuroscience with three years of experience analyzing and modeling 
    experimental data using Python. Consistently recognized for academic achievement. Enthusiastic, 
    tenacious and independent learner, passionate about the creative application of mathematical
    insight. 

    {\bf Programming:} Undergraduate research projects demonstrate familiarity with Python, R and Bash
    techniques including multiprocessing, cluster computing, data serialization and machine
    learning. 

    {\bf Statistics:} Excellent academic performance in three statistics classes, with a fourth to be
    completed before Fall 2022. Completed a neuroscience honours thesis developing a statistical algorithm
    to quantify patterns in experimental data.

    {\bf Teamwork:} Effective leadership, communication and collaboration skills developed over the
    course of research, a rapid prototyping competition and former career as an emergency medical services
    practitioner and supervisor. 

    {\bf Versatility:} Highly capable of independently learning complex topics and skills. Nearly all 
    programming knowledge was self-taught. Prerequisite mathematical theory underlying research was
    learned outside of coursework.
